# Qwen2.5-VL × LongVideoBench — KV-cache Quantization Experiments

**Status as of 2026-05-07:** Exp A 7/8 conditions complete (A8 in progress, 98/200). Calibration + Exp B pending.

## Context

Pivot from the saturated pi0.5 / LIBERO line. There, `Static-W2-l13-17` already hits 100% on standard LIBERO Long (and ~92% on the n=64 partial Pareto sweep — see `EXPERIMENT_FINDINGS.md`), leaving no rescue gap for AttnEntropy gating to demonstrate value. Long-video VLMs are unsaturated (Qwen2.5-VL-7B reports 54.7% on LongVideoBench-val), and long videos produce thousands of visual tokens so KV-cache memory and precision are the active bottleneck. Recent literature (MEDA, AKVQ-VL, VidKV, MadaKV) frames KV-quant as the open problem.

**Research question.** Can attention entropy allocate per-(layer, head, token) KV-cache *precision* better than uniform / random / attention-mass / MEDA-style baselines on long-video VLM inference?

The thesis splits into two halves:
- **Experiment A** establishes that uniform KV quantization is non-trivially harmful — i.e., that there's a "rescuable regime" where BF16 is correct but uniform-quantized is wrong, with enough headroom for a controller to recover.
- **Experiment B** tests whether AttnEntropy V1/V2 controllers, with thresholds frozen on a 100-item calibration set, beat uniform / random / MEDA-style allocation at matched ~3 average KV bits on a held-out 200-item evaluation set.

## Setup

- **Model:** `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` — 28 decoder layers, 28 query heads, 4 KV heads (GQA: each KV head shared by 7 Q heads), `head_dim=128`. AWQ checkpoint also pulled (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct-AWQ`).
- **Benchmark:** LongVideoBench validation split (1337 items; mixed 4-way and 5-way MCQ).
- **Stratified split** (seed=0): 100 calibration / 200 evaluation, per-bucket counts:
  | Bucket | Duration | n cal | n eval |
  |---|---|---:|---:|
  | short | 0–15s | 17 | 33 |
  | mid | 15–60s | 17 | 33 |
  | long | 60–600s | 33 | 67 |
  | very_long | 600–3600s | 33 | 67 |
- **Frame budget:** 64 frames per video at `max_pixels=360×420` → ~3000–3500 visual tokens per item.
- **Scoring:** greedy decode, `max_new_tokens=1`, then 4- or 5-way logprob over `["A","B","C","D",("E")]` token ids; predict `argmax`.
- **Hardware:** tambe-server-1 H100 80 GB (GPU 0), shared with another user's ~50 GB co-tenant.

## Core primitive: `FakeQuantKVCache`

A subclass of `transformers.cache_utils.DynamicCache`. On every `update(K, V, layer_idx)` call, K and V are fake-quantized to an N-bit grid using **per-channel symmetric quantization along `head_dim`** (`group_size=128`). Tensors stay BF16 in storage; values are rounded to the integer grid.

Why this affects prefill logits: Qwen2.5-VL's SDPA forward feeds the **return value** of `cache.update(...)` into the attention matmul, so the rounded tensors are what hit the SDPA kernel. Validated end-to-end on 4 text prompts and 1 video item: ‖Δ_logits‖∞ = 18.7 between BF16 and INT2-KV first-token logits (well above the 1e-3 smoke threshold).

`BitController` modes:
- **V1** — scalar bits per layer (Exp B's primary AttnEntropy variant)
- **V2** — `[num_kv_heads]=[4]` bits per layer (per-KV-head allocation under GQA)
- **V3** — per-token protected mask + hi/lo bits *(deferred; needs eager attention runtime hook for live entropy)*

Quant math is lifted directly from `scripts/utils.py:fake_quantize_module`:
```
qmax = 2 ** (bits − 1) − 1
g    = x.reshape(..., -1, group_size)
s    = g.abs().amax(-1, keepdim=True).clamp_min(1e-8) / qmax
x_hat = ((g / s).round().clamp(-qmax, qmax) * s).reshape_as(x)
```
At `bits=2` this collapses to ternary {−s, 0, +s}. At `bits=8` the FP8 path uses an E4M3 round-trip cast (or falls through to INT8 grid if PyTorch's FP8 isn't available). At `bits>=16` it's a no-op.

### Per-duration-bucket breakdown

| Condition | short (n=33) | mid (n=33) | long (n=67) | very_long (n=67) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A1 BF16 | 0.667 | 0.848 | 0.537 | 0.403 |
| A2 W4 fake | 0.636 | 0.848 | 0.478 | 0.403 |

| A5 INT4 KV | 0.303 | 0.242 | 0.164 | 0.194 |
| A6 INT4-K/INT8-V | 0.303 | 0.242 | 0.209 | 0.269 |

### Key findings

1. **Weight-only quantization is essentially lossless.** A2 (W4 fake-quant) and A3 (real AWQ) both land at 54.0% — identical to one decimal, only 2.5 pp below BF16. The two preserve different items (BF16-correct preservation: A2=86.7%, A3=88.5%) but converge on the same aggregate accuracy. **The action is not in weight quantization.**

2. **Uniform KV quantization is catastrophic at every bit width tested.** All four KV-only conditions (A4 FP8, A5 INT4, A6 INT4-K/INT8-V, A7 INT2) collapse to 21–27% — at or near 4-way chance. A bigger drop than published long-video KV literature (VidKV reports ~5 pp drop at sub-2-bit with their static method) — confirms uniform allocation is the wrong lever.

3. **Asymmetric K/V doesn't rescue.** A6 (INT4-K / INT8-V) sits at 25.0% — between A4 FP8 (25.5%) and A5 INT4 (21.0%) and well within bootstrap CI of both. Bumping V to 8-bit recovers ~4 pp vs full INT4, but K is the dominant bottleneck and full uniform precision can't be saved by per-tensor asymmetry.

4. **INT2 ternary slightly outperforms INT4 and FP8.** A7 (27.0%) > A4 (25.5%) > A5 (21.0%). Counterintuitive at first, but mechanistically plausible: ternary {−s, 0, +s} preserves *sign + scale* of each (head, token, channel) row exactly, which is precisely what attention's "which key matches" structure depends on. Coarser non-adaptive 8-bit (FP8 E4M3 with 3-bit mantissa) and even per-channel INT4 lose more relative-magnitude information than ternary.

5. **The rescuable regime is enormous.** With BF16 at 56.5% and any uniform KV-quant at ~25%, AttnEntropy V1/V2 in Exp B has ~30 pp of headroom to recover. This is the strongest "rescue regime" in any of our experiments to date — orders of magnitude wider than the LIBERO line's 4-trial rescuable bucket on standard LIBERO at W4.

6. **Combining weight-quant with KV-quant follows KV-quant.** A8 (AWQ + INT4 KV, partial) sits at 22.4% — within bootstrap CI of A5 (INT4 KV, 21.0%). Weight-quant doesn't compound the KV penalty; KV-quant is the dominant cost.

7. **Per-bucket pattern**: BF16 shows the expected duration gradient (short > mid > long > very_long, modulo the mid-bucket anomaly noted below). All KV-quant conditions flatten this gradient — precision loss hurts every duration roughly equally, not selectively at long durations. This argues against the simple hypothesis that "long videos need more bits". *A counterargument to the duration-aware allocation strategy in MEDA, which we'll test directly via baseline B4.*

### Anomaly: mid bucket is harder *easier* than short on BF16

A1 BF16 has acc 0.667 on short (n=33), 0.848 on mid (n=33), 0.537 on long (n=67), 0.403 on very_long (n=67). Mid being 18 pp above short is unexpected — typical assumption is monotonic harder-with-duration. Could be a small-n stratification artifact (n=33 per bucket); could also reflect that short clips on LongVideoBench are more often "needle-in-haystack" temporal localization questions (harder per-frame) while mid clips have cleaner narrative structure. Worth sanity-checking on the full validation set in a future run.

## Methodological lessons learned

Three issues caught and fixed during this run; documenting them so they don't bite the next person:

1. **`torch>=2.10` ships CUDA-13 wheels that silently fall back to CPU on driver 12.6.** First calibration run completed in 7 seconds because the model was on CPU — `torch.cuda.is_available()` returned False with a non-fatal warning. Pinned to `torch==2.5.1+cu124` in `setup_qwen_env.sh`.

2. **Qwen2.5-VL's SDPA forward returns `attn_weights=None` regardless of `output_attentions=True`.** The kwarg is vestigial in the unified attention forward (it's just an unused parameter). The entropy hook for calibration silently produced NaN. Calibration now loads with `attn_implementation="eager"` (committed in `calibrate.py`).

3. **Memory hygiene matters under co-tenant pressure.** A1 finished cleanly at 200/200 then A2 OOM'd 7 seconds later because PyTorch's allocator didn't return the cumulative cache to the OS. Added `gc.collect() + torch.cuda.empty_cache()` every 5 items inside `run_inference.run_condition`, plus `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` for the resume run. Also wrote an in-place `fake_quantize_weights_w4` (no `saved` clone) so the W4 path doesn't peak at 28 GB during the swap.

4. **Chunked entropy computation** to avoid OOM during calibration: `_entropy_from_attn` now chunks over the query dim and accumulates a `[H]` FP32 buffer instead of materializing the full `[B, H, Q, K]` FP32 tensor (~3 GB at H=28, Q=K=3000).

```

ETA from now: A8 ~5 min + calibration ~15 min + Exp B (6 × ~18 min) ~110 min ≈ **2 more hours**.

## Experiment B — preview

Will run after Exp A finishes. Tests at matched ~3 avg KV bits:

| # | Method | Granularity |
|---|---|---|
| B0 | Uniform INT4 (4 bits) | — (Pareto anchor) |
| B1 | Uniform INT2 (2 bits) | — (Pareto anchor) |
| B2 | Random mixed INT2/INT4 → ~3 avg | layer (3 seeds) |
| B4 | MEDA-style entropy bit budget | layer |
| **B6** | **AttnEntropy V1** | **per-layer**, tertile-binned to {2, 4, 8} bits |
| **B7** | **AttnEntropy V2** | **per-(layer, KV-head)**, tertile-binned |

**B3 (attention-mass token protection) and B8 (V3 token-level)** are deferred — they require live attention weights during evaluation, which Qwen2.5-VL's SDPA backend doesn't expose. A v2 round will plumb eager attention through `expB_attnentropy.py` to enable them.

### Success criterion (Exp B)

At matched avg ≈ 3 KV bits, AttnEntropy V1 (B6) and V2 (B7) must:
1. Pareto-dominate (a) Uniform INT4 (B0) and Uniform INT2 (B1), (b) Random mixed (B2), (c) MEDA-style entropy bit budget (B4).
2. Recover a substantial fraction of the 30 pp BF16-vs-uniform-quant gap. Even partial recovery (e.g., reaching 35% from 25% baseline at avg=3 bits) would be a real result given the unprecedentedly large rescue surface area on this benchmark.
